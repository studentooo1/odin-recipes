    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Qita is a popular traditional dish along the North horn of africa specifically among the cushitic people. In its blant original form it is a round shaped maize flour based food cooked on a somewhat frying pan and flipped for both sides to get acces to the cooking oil. It tasty and can be eaten with almost any stew. It is cooked in large numbers so naturally it take sits around for two to three days before it is copmletely. The downside is that it looses its moisture and some flavour as it sits around and that's what brings us to want to flavour our Qita. After doing so the result is amazing and some might even say better than its original form. </p>
